- I will fix the gitlab account conflict and push latest iteration soon.
- I will share the deployed-frontend link soon.
- Toggle Could be a custom hook to avoid reptition
- Revision buttons can be disabled when everything is revised
- persist / manage on page refresh (manage first render)
- restyle buttons with no opacity so I can make a sticky top-0 navbar
- refining styling would make the app 50% more modern and user friendly. But it's a very low priority ( will leave it for last ).
- scroll to paragraph on Navigation
- File names after upload
